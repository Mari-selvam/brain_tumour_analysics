# Brain Tumor Analysis Project

This project leverages TensorFlow for deep learning, Streamlit for creating an interactive web application, and MySQL for database management. The primary goal is to analyze brain tumor images, classify the type of tumor, and update the results in a MySQL database for live updates on a Grafana dashboard.
